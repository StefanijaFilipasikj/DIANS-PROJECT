    Today, technology provides a simple way to navigate through the environment.
    Often people want to spend their free time outside their homes, but find themselves
    in a situation where they have no idea where they could be headed. So, we came up
    with an idea to solve this great dilemma, and at the same time to contribute to the
    development of the cultural awareness of people.

    We've created a web app that makes it fast and easy to discover cultural-historical
    landmarks in North Macedonia. The app also recommends intriguing places users might
    not be aware of.

    The main target group of our application would be the citizens who live in our country,
    but it will also be of great help to the tourists that want to visit the
    cultural-historical landmarks in North Macedonia.
  </div>
  <div>
    The main functionality of our web application is to provide users with the exact
    location of the cultural-historical landmark on a map. To build our web application we
    used the open database of OpenStreetMap that helped us to get to the exact locations for
    each landmark.
